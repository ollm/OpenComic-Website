## Code

We welcome contributions to the OpenComic code! Whether you're fixing bugs, adding new features, or improving documentation, your help is appreciated.

Whenever possible, try to maintain the current coding style.

### Bug Fixes

For small fixes or minor corrections, feel free to open a pull request directly.

For larger changes or if you’re uncertain, please open an issue or a draft pull request first to discuss your approach.

### Feature Implementations

For major changes or enhancements, please open an issue or a draft pull request first so we can review your contribution.

### Tracking

If you want to add support for a new tracking site, you can refer to the existing implementations — [Anilist](https://github.com/ollm/OpenComic/blob/master/scripts/tracking/anilist/anilist.js) and [MyAnimeList](https://github.com/ollm/OpenComic/blob/master/scripts/tracking/myanimelist/myanimelist.js) — or use the [example implementation](https://github.com/ollm/OpenComic/blob/master/scripts/tracking/example/example.js) as a starting point.

Additionally, you'll need to update both [`tracking-sites.js`](https://github.com/ollm/OpenComic/blob/master/scripts/tracking/tracking-sites.js) and [`tracking-sites-keys.js`](https://github.com/ollm/OpenComic/blob/master/scripts/tracking/tracking-sites-keys.js) to include the new site's information.

# Labels

You can organize folders and files by **labels**.

---

## Pages

Labels pages can be found in the sidebar.

#### Only From Root Folders

You can choose to display only the labels items located in **root folders** such as the Library, [Master folders](master-folders), [Servers](servers), etc. This option hides any folder that are located in subfolders.

This helps keep your labels view clean and focused on top-level content.

## Filter by Folder

You can also **filter labels within the current folder**. This allows you to see only the labels contained in that specific folder.

## Apply presets/config by labels

You can automatically apply a [preset/config](/docs/guides/reading/presets) if the current folder—or any of its parent folders—has a specific label.

The **Favorites** feature allows you to quickly access important files and folders by marking them as favorites.

#### Only From Root Folders

You can choose to display only the favorite items located in **root folders** such as the Library, [Master folders](master-folders), [Servers](servers), etc. This option hides any favorite items that are located in subfolders.

This helps keep your favorites view clean and focused on top-level content.

## Filter by Folder

You can also **filter favorites within the current folder**. This allows you to see only the favorites contained in that specific folder.

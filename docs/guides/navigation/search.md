# Search

Search within the current folders and inside them all compatible files (Folder, compressed and images); the results will appear below the search field.

Since this may read through all the folders, it can be slow. If you only want to search within the current page without subfolders, you can use the [Find](/docs/guides/navigation/find) function.

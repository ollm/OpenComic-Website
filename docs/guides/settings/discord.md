# Discord Rich Presence

OpenComic supports **Discord Rich Presence (RPC)** to display what you are currently reading on your Discord profile.

It will show the title of the reading (extracted from metadata whenever possible, such as from `ComicInfo.xml`), volume (if detected), chapter (if detected), pages, and percentage read.

The reading/play time is tracked during the current session (separately for each reading) and resets when OpenComic is closed.

**Discord Rich Presence** is disabled by default and must be enabled manually in the app settings.

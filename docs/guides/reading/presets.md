# Presets

Presets allow you to save and apply configurations with a single click or automatically using labels.

Only the config under [eBook Layout](/docs/guides/reading/ebook-layout), [Page Layout](/docs/guides/reading/page-layout), and [Color Filters](/docs/guides/reading/color-filters) are stored in the preset.

----

### Global configuration

The global configuration is applied the first time a file or folder is opened. It can be edited just like a preset.

----

### Auto-apply configuration to folders/files with labels

You can configure OpenComic to automatically apply a preset if a folder has a specific label.
